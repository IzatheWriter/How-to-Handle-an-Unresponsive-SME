<h1>Tip 1: Write the second e-mail</h1>

Sounds silly? Not really! If your SME hasn’t replied to your first e-mail message, perhaps your meeting request has been too vague.
Write the second message only make it a little different. Remind them politely why you’re contacting again, specify in points what it is exactly you’d like to discuss and estimate how much time you need (roughly) to get information for your work. Finally, suggest possible dates you could meet and whether or not they would be suitable for them. This outline will give your SME a much clearer idea of your request. It will also require them to think about and decide on the possible meeting date.
If the e-mail way doesn’t work, don’t hesitate to pay a visit in person in their office. Remember, though, to be friendly and kind when you inquire about the meeting.
