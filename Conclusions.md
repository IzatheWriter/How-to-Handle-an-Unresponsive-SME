<h1>Conclusions</h1>

I reckon that the most serious problem with effective communication today is assuming people are bad and not really eager to help us. The above tips are meant to show you that we should come to others with a positive attitude first. If someone doesnâ€™t want to cooperate, yes, they do have a problem but it may really not be their fault. You have the power to show someone empathy and understanding and you will be surprised how much of this will receive in return.
