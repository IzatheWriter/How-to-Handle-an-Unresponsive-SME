<h1>Tip 4: Be a good and active listener</h1>

A good listener is not one which is staring back at you and nodding obediently to every word you say. You will, obviously, listen more to what your SME has to say on their subject, but active listening means occasional follow-up questions to ask for more details which you'll need for your work. Even better if they can show you how the aforementioned boring machine works. Probably, they won’t allow you to use it yourself but I'm certain that driving a new car model or using an application won’t be a problem.
