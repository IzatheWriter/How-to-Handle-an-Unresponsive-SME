<h1>Tip 2: Build a friendly rapport</h1>

It is highly plausible that your SME works in the same company as yours. They would go for a coffee break or take part in the company’s integration time. Make the most of this time. Be open to people, talk to them, show interest in their expertise but don’t just talk shop. Try chatting about their hobbies and time off work. You never know, perhaps you share common interests which could spark an interesting relationship and make them more amiable in the future to help you.
