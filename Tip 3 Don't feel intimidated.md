<h1>Tip 3: Don't feel intimidated</h1>

Despite the SMEs broad knowledge of rocket science or quantum physics they’re still human beings like you and me. There’s no need to feel shy or self-conscious when asking them questions. Use this lack to your advantage and become a curious child who wants to know all about the construction of a boring machine. Remember, though, that you need a basic preparation before the meeting. Make sure you know what a boring machine looks like and what it’s used for. Try to find some information beforehand so that you have a list of concrete questions for them to answer. They'll respect this effort and be much happier to explain your doubts and fill in the gaps of your findings.
