<h1>Tip 5: Empathy</h1>

Simon Sinek, a business and life coach, said that the key to effective communication is empathy. And I agree. We are people who are going through our daily troubles which frequently affect our work life. As a result, it might occur that your SME might react with anger for being “bothered” time and again about providing you with information for your work. In that case, bear in mind someone might just have a problem they cannot handle emotionally. You don’t have play a psychologist but show empathy and talk about their feelings first before you jump into discussion the boring machine basic functions. Following Simon Sinek: “We have to start practising empathy and relate to what they may be going through and it will profoundly change the decision we make, it will profoundly change the way we see the world.” Don’t forget about yourself too. You have a job to do and sometimes you may not feel strong enough to deliver what other people expect from you.
