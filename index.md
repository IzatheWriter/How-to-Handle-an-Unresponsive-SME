<h1>A Quick Guide on How to Handle an Unresponsive SME</h1>

A technical writer has a lot on their plate when it comes to collating data for their final documentation work. Best of luck when you can just use the written accounts or do some online research to be able to describe it. However, that’s not usually the case as an important aspect of the job is effective communication with other people who will instruct you in the topic you’re writing about. These people are referred to as SMEs which stands for Subject Matter Experts.
 
Experts in what? You might ask. Their expertise will vary from UX design, customer support, development, engineering, etc. Your understanding of the product or the process you’re writing about will depend heavily on their knowledge and explanation of the matter. 

The problem arises when those just as hard-working people as you are difficult to access or not that eager to devote their precious worktime to speak with you.
Hence, in this article you'll find a few quick tips to help you with an unresponsive SME.
